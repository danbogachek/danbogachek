## Execution

I met with the client as they were establishing their independent real estate practice. Their main goals were to:
- Establish credibility online
- Showcase their various real estate services
- Provide contact information and channels of communication to their prospective clients


A large portion of their traffic would stem from their social media pages and mobile searches, which meant the site needed to be mobile-friendly. The client also wanted true ownership of their website and the ability to edit and add content. After doing some research, I went with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a Go-based static site generator. I deployed it on Netlify along with Netlify CMS, which allows easy access for editing content.

[Here is the finished website.](https://www.okeyandassociates.com/)

## Conclusion

Client was happy with the website. I'm pretty happy with how the footer turned out.
